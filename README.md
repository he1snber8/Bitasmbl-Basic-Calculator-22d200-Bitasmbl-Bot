# Bitasmbl-Basic-Calculator-22d200-Bitasmbl-Bot

## Description
Create a simple web-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project focuses on interactive UI, event handling, and state management.

## Tech Stack
- Nuxt.js

## Requirements
- Perform basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Update the display dynamically when buttons are clicked
- Handle edge cases such as division by zero
- Provide a clear and intuitive layout for buttons and display

## Installation
bash
git clone https://github.com/he1snber8/Bitasmbl-Basic-Calculator-22d200-Bitasmbl-Bot.git
cd Bitasmbl-Basic-Calculator-22d200-Bitasmbl-Bot
npm install


## Usage
bash
npm run dev


## Implementation Steps
1. Initialize a Nuxt.js project structure.
2. Create a calculator page with display and buttons.
3. Implement state management for operands, operator, and result.
4. Add event handlers for button clicks to update state and display.
5. Implement arithmetic logic, including division-by-zero handling.
6. Style the layout for a clear, intuitive calculator interface.
